golang docker/docker-compose with delve and dev and production section

## AI Assistant
To configure a **Golang project** with **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, and **Delve** for debugging, while separating the **development** and **production** environments, you can follow this guide.

Below, I outline a *typical setup* for such a requirement.

---

### **General Structure**
Your project directory may look something like this:

```
project/
├── Dockerfile           # For production
├── Dockerfile.dev       # For development/debugging
├── docker-compose.yml   # Defines services
├── main.go              # Your application code
├── go.mod               # Dependencies
└── other project files...
```

---

### **Dockerfile for Production**
This is a typical **multi-stage build** Dockerfile for production. It builds your Go binary and runs it in a minimal container (e.g., `alpine`).

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM golang:1.20 as builder

WORKDIR /app

# Copy go.mod and go.sum first, then download dependencies for efficient caching
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

# Copy the rest of the source code
COPY . .

# Build the binary
RUN go build -o main .

# Run stage (minimal lightweight image)
FROM alpine:latest

WORKDIR /root/

# Copy the binary from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/main .

# Expose the port your app listens on
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the binary
CMD ["./main"]
```

---

### **Dockerfile for Development (With Delve)**
For development, we also include **Delve** for debugging purposes.

```dockerfile
# Debug stage
FROM golang:1.20

WORKDIR /app

# Install Delve
RUN go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest

# Copy go.mod and go.sum and download dependencies
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

# Copy the application source code
COPY . .

# Expose application port and Delve's debug port
EXPOSE 8080 40000

# Start the application with Delve
CMD ["dlv", "debug", "--headless", "--listen=0.0.0.0:40000", "--api-version=2", "--log"]
```

---

### **docker-compose.yml**
Using **Docker Compose**, you can define different services for **production** and **development**. Here's an example:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  app:
    # Use the production-ready image
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - ENV=production

  app_dev:
    # Use the development image with Delve
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"     # Application port
      - "40000:40000"   # Delve debug port
    volumes:
      - .:/app          # Mount the source code for live editing
    environment:
      - ENV=development
      - DELVE_API_VERSION=2
```

---

### **Running Services**

- **Production**: Run only the production app.
```shell script
docker-compose up app
```

- **Development**: Run the app with debugging enabled.
```shell script
docker-compose up app_dev
```

---

### **Accessing Delve Debugger**
When running the **development mode**, you can attach a debugger to Delve using its **headless mode**.

1. **Delve API**: Delve listens on `40000` by default in the example above.
2. Use your favorite IDE (e.g., VSCode or GoLand) to connect to Delve with the remote execution setup.

#### Sample VSCode Launch Configuration:
Here's an example `launch.json` configuration for VSCode to attach to Delve:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Attach to Debuggable App",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "attach",
      "mode": "remote",
      "remotePath": "/app",
      "port": 40000,
      "host": "127.0.0.1"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **Tips**

1. **Volumes for Live Reload**: In the development configuration (`app_dev`), mounting the source code (`.:/app`) ensures that code changes automatically reflect inside the container.
   - For production, don't use volumes since the app is prebuilt.

2. **Environment Variables**: Use an `.env` or explicitly define variables in `docker-compose.yml` to distinguish between production and development configurations.

3. **Testing Multi-Containers**: If your app depends on a database or cache (e.g., `PostgreSQL`, `Redis`), you can extend the `docker-compose.yml` to include those services and link them to your app.

This configuration allows you to have a seamless development environment with debugging and a lightweight production setup. Got any specific requirements you'd like to include? Let me know!

## Me
with ubuntu and nginx

## AI Assistant
If you want to create a **Golang project** with **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, **Delve** (for debugging), and **NGINX** (as a reverse proxy for production), I adapted the configuration for Ubuntu and NGINX.

---

### **Directory Structure**

```
project/
├── Dockerfile           # For production
├── Dockerfile.dev       # For development/debugging
├── docker-compose.yml   # Services setup
├── nginx/
│   └── nginx.conf       # NGINX configuration
├── main.go              # Go application
├── go.mod               # Dependencies
└── other source files...
```

---

### **Dockerfile for Production** (With NGINX)

This **multi-stage Dockerfile** uses **Ubuntu** as a base and adds **NGINX** as a reverse proxy.

```dockerfile
# Build Stage
FROM golang:1.20 as builder

WORKDIR /app

# Copy go.mod and go.sum, and download dependencies
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

# Copy application source and build the binary
COPY . .
RUN go build -o main .

# Production Stage
FROM ubuntu:20.04

# Install required packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /root/

# Copy built Go application
COPY --from=builder /app/main .

# Copy NGINX configuration
COPY nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Expose NGINX port and app server port
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 8080

# Start NGINX and our Go application
CMD service nginx start && ./main
```

---

### **Dockerfile for Development** (With Delve)

For development, we use a similar approach but add **Delve** for debugging.

```dockerfile
# Debugging Stage
FROM ubuntu:20.04

# Install required packages and setup Go/Delve
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl git && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
RUN curl -OL https://golang.org/dl/go1.20.linux-amd64.tar.gz && \
    tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.linux-amd64.tar.gz && \
    rm go1.20.linux-amd64.tar.gz

ENV PATH="/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH"

WORKDIR /app

# Install Delve
RUN GOPATH=/root/go /usr/local/go/bin/go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest

# Copy application source
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download
COPY . .

# Expose Go app port and Delve debugging port
EXPOSE 8080 40000

# Start the application in debug mode
CMD ["dlv", "exec", "./main", "--headless", "--listen=0.0.0.0:40000", "--api-version=2", "--log"]
```

---

### **NGINX Configuration**

Place this file in the `nginx/nginx.conf` directory. It configures NGINX as a reverse proxy for your Go app.

```
user nginx;
worker_processes auto;
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
pid /run/nginx.pid;

events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type application/octet-stream;

    sendfile on;
    keepalive_timeout 65;

    upstream app_backend {
        server 127.0.0.1:8080; # Go app
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://app_backend;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **docker-compose.yml**

This **docker-compose.yml** includes both the production and development configurations with appropriate services.

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  nginx:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "80:80"        # NGINX will listen on port 80
      - "8080:8080"    # Optional: Expose the app server directly
    environment:
      - ENV=production

  dev:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"    # Application HTTP port
      - "40000:40000"  # Delve debug port
    volumes:
      - .:/app         # Mount local code for live updates
    environment:
      - ENV=development
      - DELVE_API_VERSION=2
```

---

### **Running the Setup**

- **Production**: To run the app behind NGINX:
```shell script
docker-compose up nginx
```
  The app will be accessible at `http://localhost`.

- **Development**: To debug the app with Delve:
```shell script
docker-compose up dev
```

---

### **Accessing the Debugger with Delve**

When running the `dev` service, you can attach your debugger to the Delve backend.

#### VSCode Example `launch.json`:
```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Attach Debugger (Delve)",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "attach",
      "mode": "remote",
      "remotePath": "/app",
      "port": 40000,
      "host": "127.0.0.1"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **Key Notes**

1. **Volumes for Development**: Mount source code using the `dev` service, so changes are reflected without rebuilding the container.

2. **Environments**: Use environment variables for configuration differences (like database URLs) between `production` and `development`.

3. **NGINX Logging**: Logs can be useful in debugging errors (e.g., `/var/log/nginx/error.log`).

4. **Testing Multi-Services**: If your app relies on a database or other services, extend the `docker-compose.yml` file to include necessary configurations.

Let me know if you need further adjustments!

## Me
from ubuntu dockerfile

## AI Assistant
To create a **Golang project** with **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, **Delve**, and **NGINX**, using **Ubuntu** as the base image (instead of alpine or others), here's a refined setup:

---

### **Directory Structure**
```
project/
├── Dockerfile           # Production setup (Ubuntu-based, with NGINX)
├── Dockerfile.dev       # Development setup (Ubuntu-based, with Delve)
├── docker-compose.yml   # Compose configuration
├── nginx/
│   └── nginx.conf       # NGINX configuration
├── main.go              # Main Go application
├── go.mod               # Go dependencies
└── other source files...
```

---

### **Production Dockerfile** (`Dockerfile`)

This file builds the application and sets up **NGINX** as a reverse proxy to serve the app. It uses **Ubuntu** as the base image.

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM ubuntu:20.04 as builder

# Install Go and required tools
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    git \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
RUN curl -OL https://golang.org/dl/go1.20.linux-amd64.tar.gz && \
    tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.linux-amd64.tar.gz && \
    rm go1.20.linux-amd64.tar.gz

ENV PATH="/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH"

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Go module files, download dependencies
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

# Copy the source code into the container
COPY . .

# Compile the app
RUN go build -o main .

# Final stage - Production
FROM ubuntu:20.04

# Install NGINX
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set up working directory
WORKDIR /root/

# Copy the compiled Go binary
COPY --from=builder /app/main .

# Copy NGINX configuration
COPY nginx/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Expose ports
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 8080

# Run NGINX and the Go app
CMD ["bash", "-c", "service nginx start && ./main"]
```

---

### **Development Dockerfile** (`Dockerfile.dev`)

This file is designed for **development** with **Delve** for debugging. It uses **Ubuntu** as the base image and mounts the source code for live changes.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

# Install required tools
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    git \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Go
RUN curl -OL https://golang.org/dl/go1.20.linux-amd64.tar.gz && \
    tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.linux-amd64.tar.gz && \
    rm go1.20.linux-amd64.tar.gz

ENV PATH="/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH"

# Install Delve for debugging
RUN /usr/local/go/bin/go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency files and download packages
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

# Copy all source code
COPY . .

# Expose app and Delve debug ports
EXPOSE 8080 40000

# Command to run the app in debug mode
CMD ["dlv", "exec", "./main", "--headless", "--listen=0.0.0.0:40000", "--api-version=2", "--log"]
```

---

### **NGINX Configuration** (`nginx/nginx.conf`)

This configures NGINX as a reverse proxy for the Go application.

```
worker_processes 1;

events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type application/octet-stream;

    server {
        listen 80;

        # Proxy requests to the Go application
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **docker-compose.yml**

The **Docker Compose** configuration includes services for **production** and **development** environments.

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  # Production service with NGINX
  nginx:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "80:80"        # NGINX port exposed to the host
    environment:
      - ENV=production

  # Development service with Delve
  dev:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"    # Application port
      - "40000:40000"  # Delve debug port
    volumes:
      - .:/app         # Mount the local code for live updates
    environment:
      - ENV=development
      - DELVE_API_VERSION=2
```

---

### **Running the Containers**

#### For Production:
Run the production-ready service with **NGINX**.
```shell script
docker-compose up -d nginx
```
- Access your app at `http://localhost`.

#### For Development:
Run the `dev` service to enable debugging.
```shell script
docker-compose up dev
```
- Your app will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
- Delve debugger will be available at port `40000`. IDEs (like VSCode) can attach for debugging.

---

### **Debugging with Delve**

If you're using **VSCode**, you can configure it to attach to Delve for debugging.

`launch.json` for VSCode:
```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Attach Delve",
      "type": "go",
      "request": "attach",
      "mode": "remote",
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 40000,
      "remotePath": "/app"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### **Key Points**

1. **Environment-Specific Images**:
   - Use `Dockerfile` for production with **NGINX**.
   - Use `Dockerfile.dev` for development with **Delve**.

2. **NGINX Configuration**:
   - NGINX serves as the reverse proxy in production, exposing port `80`.

3. **Live Code Updates in Development**:
   - The volume mount (`.:/app`) in the dev service ensures that local code changes are synced inside the container.

4. **Debugging with Delve**:
   - Expose port `40000` for remote debugging, and use an IDE with support for Delve remote connections.

5. **Ubuntu Image**:
   - Using Ubuntu allows you to use familiar Linux tools and configurations. Adjust to your specific version if needed.
